# Email Spam Filter using Naive Bayes Classifier
## Introduction
This project implements a simple email spam filter using the Naive Bayes classifier, a popular probabilistic machine learning algorithm. The filter categorizes emails into spam or non-spam based on the content of the emails.
The Naive Bayes classifier is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes independence between features. It's particularly well-suited for text classification tasks like spam filtering due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
## Features
- Classifies emails as spam or non-spam using Naive Bayes.
- Handles large datasets efficiently.
- High accuracy and performance.
- Easy to use and modify.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DawnJo123/Spam-Filter-using-Naive-Bayes-Classifier.git
    
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd Spam-Filter-using-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
    ```

## Dataset
You can use any email dataset for this project. A dataset is already placed in the datset folder. Replace that dataset with your dataset if you want.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset.
